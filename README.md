# Handwritten digit classification 

Handwritten digit classification is a machine learning project aimed at building a model that can recognize handwritten digits in images. The project involves using a dataset of labeled images to train a machine learning model, which can then be used to predict the digit in new, unseen images.

## Steps 
To start the project, the first step would be to collect a suitable dataset of handwritten digit images, which are labeled with the corresponding digit. This dataset can be obtained from publicly available sources, such as the MNIST or USPS datasets, or can be created manually by collecting and labeling images.

Next, the dataset would be preprocessed to prepare it for training. This would typically involve normalizing the pixel values to a standard range and splitting the dataset into training, validation, and test sets.

The next step would be to choose an appropriate machine learning algorithm for the task. One popular approach is to use a convolutional neural network (CNN), which is a type of neural network that is designed to process images. The CNN would be trained on the labeled training set using a suitable optimization algorithm, such as stochastic gradient descent.

Once the model has been trained, its performance would be evaluated on the validation set to tune its hyperparameters and avoid overfitting. Finally, the model would be tested on the test set to get an estimate of its real-world performance.

If the model performs well on the test set, it can be deployed in a production environment to recognize handwritten digits in new images. This could be done using an application or service that takes an image as input and returns the predicted digit.
